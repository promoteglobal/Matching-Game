**Note to the project reviewers:** Since this was the first time using Git/Bash and a new text editor at the same time, (I switched from notepad++ to Atom because I wanted to try out emmet for the first time as well.) I had a fatal error early on in the creation of this project that caused my .html and .js files to completely deleted itself right after I uploaded everything to github.  It happened right after I uploaded the first couple of commits.  Lucky, I was able to re-download everything into a new file and delete the old one.  Unfortunately, I continued to experience crashes with bash that caused it to be non-responsive. I had to reinstall it about once a day for the first 3 days.  After that it seemed to crash after about 20 mins.  I didn't want to have to continue to reinstall it in also fear of having a fatal error again. I waited till end of this project to save all my work into a separate file just incase there was a fatal error so I could submit my work.  I will also try and simulate commits to prove that I know how to do commits.  Thank you!
